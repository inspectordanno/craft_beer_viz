        <h2>A Visual Insight into<h2> 
        <h1>U.S. Craft Beers</h1>
        <h3>by Dan Spector</h3>

    <p>Craft breweries are the fastest growing segment of the American beer industry. In 2017, while total U.S. beer sales were actually down 1.2% from the previous year, craft beer sales were up a whopping 5%. In addition, overall production of beer was down 1% in 2017, whereas craft breweries produced 5% more beer by volume. What makes craft breweries so appealing?</p>
    <div class="craft_definition">
      <div class="craft_category" id="size">Size</div>
      <p class="craft_desc">Annual production of barrels of beer in a craft brewery must equal 6 million barrels or less. This equates to approximately 3% of annual U.S. beer sales.</p>
      <div class="craft_category" id="independence">Independence</div>
      <p class="craft_desc">Only 25% or less of a craft brewery can be controlled by another beverage alcohol industry member. This member cannot itself be a craft brewery.</p>
      <div class="craft_category" id="tradition">Tradition</div>
      <p class="craft_desc">A majority of the alcohol content of a craft beer must derive from the fermentation process. For instance, a flavored malt beverage does not count as a craft beer.</p>

    <p>The visualizations below present a snapshot of American craft beers and breweries, organized by state. It is not an exhaustive list, merely a sampling. Cheers!</p>
