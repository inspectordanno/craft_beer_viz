    <h1>A Visual Insight into U.S. Craft Beers</h1>
    <p>Craft breweries are the fastest growing segment of the American beer industry. In 2017, while total U.S. beer sales were actually down 1.2% from the previous year, craft beer sales were up a whopping 5%. In addition, overall production of beer was down 1% in 2017, whereas craft breweries produced 5% more beer by volume.</p>
    <p>What makes craft breweries so appealing? The answer might lie in the categories that define them:</p>
    <div class="craft_definition">
      <div class="craft_category" id="size">Size</div>
      <p class="craft_desc">Annual production of barrels of beer must equal 6 million barrels or less, which equates to approximately 3% of annual U.S. beer sales.</p>
      <div class="craft_category" id="independence">Independence</div>
      <p class="craft_desc">A beverage alcohol industry member can only control less than 25% of a craft brewery. This member cannot itself be a craft brewer.</p>
      <div class="craft_category" id="tradition">Tradition</div>
      <p class="craft_desc">A majority of the alcohol content of a craft beer must derive from the fermentation process. For instance, a flavored malt beverage does not count as a craft beer.</p>
